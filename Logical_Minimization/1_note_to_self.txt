Notes To Self:

! Don't forget the answer key

Part 1: 

room to expand, if we need to

Part 2:

could include repeat for function L, but might be of limited utility...

MIMO --

the fact that for inputs, 
  you perform XOR
the fact that for outputs,
  you perform AND

implicant chart--tweak and make new cases:
1) implicants now covering "extra" minterms
2) implicants now not covering "reduced" minterms

Case 2: still have to cover the "reduced" minterms somehow: get <redundancy> --nonideal, but f_minimized is still =f
Case 1: take away "extra" minterms, and suddenly, you remove guarantee that they will be covered when all is said and done

..now how do I make a Part out of this...
