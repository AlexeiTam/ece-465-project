# ece-465-project

This project aims to provide a series of instructional lab experiments for the ECE 465 course to employ, as a helpful 
tool and supplement to further reinforce concepts that have been explored and discussed in class, and further provide 
experiences valuable to professional development further down the line.

The labs cover topics as follows:

1 - Logic Minimization
--Students will review the basics of Boolean algebra and implement the Karnaugh Map (K-map) and Quine-McCluskey (tabular) methods to minimize Boolean functions, and to realize said Boolean functions in a logic circuit.

2 - Combinational Circuit Analysis
--Students will focus on exploring the uses of various key combinational circuit components like encoders and decoders, multiplexers (MUX), and comparators, in the context of a seaside eatery's customer console, using priority encoders to "count" payments, comparators to check payments, decoders to determine order availabilities, etc., implementing "checks" to an order and ensuring the kitchen is "pinged" only when an order is accepted.


3 - Combinational Circuit Design
--Students will continue developing and refining understanding of combinational circuit components and their uses, in the context of a particle accelerator trigger system, which will accept inputs based on the results of the event and the user's preferences, and must return an output 1 if an event is accepted, and 0 if not.  Students must use a combination of decoders/encoders to map information of particle detection to "cases", multiplexers to decide whether the user's preferences and event detection information match, comparators to enforce momentum thresholds, etc.
