*Review* all hazard free solns, make final checks

Find the time to learn Verilog,
and if that fails, see how to get timing diagrams 
in CircuitVerse (need to add delay timers) and Logisim-evolution (need to slip in buffers) to work 

maybe even use Python to make some *really* crisp graphs...

INVENTORY:

Part 1:

Lab4HazardBSM -- implementation of the BSM with the hazards
Lab4HazardBSM_QuickFix -- using 


More ways to challenge students:
--only give the hazardous implementations
--make implementations only w/ NANDs and/or NORs, and maybe only w/ the chips
